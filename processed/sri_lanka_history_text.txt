Sri Lanka History Overview
1. Prehistoric Era
Sri Lanka’s history dates back over 125,000 years, with evidence of prehistoric settlements such as
the Balangoda Man. Early humans practiced hunting and gathering, later forming more complex
societies.
2. Ancient Kingdoms (543 BCE – 1232 CE)
According to the Mahavamsa, Prince Vijaya arrived from North India around 543 BCE, marking the
start of recorded history. The Anuradhapura Kingdom (377 BCE–1017 CE) was famous for
irrigation systems, stupas like Ruwanweliseya, and the spread of Buddhism under King
Devanampiya Tissa with the arrival of Arahat Mahinda.
The Polonnaruwa period (1017–1232 CE) saw rulers like King Parakramabahu I who built
Parakrama Samudra and strengthened the kingdom’s military and economic systems.
3. Transitional Kingdoms (13th–16th Century)
Power shifted across Dambadeniya, Yapahuwa, Kurunegala, Gampola, and Kotte. The Jaffna
Kingdom in the North flourished during this period with strong Tamil influence.
4. Colonial Era (1505–1948)
Sri Lanka was colonized in three stages:
(cid:127) Portuguese (1505–1658): Controlled coastal areas, introduced Christianity, and fought with local
kingdoms.

trade.
(cid:127) British (1796–1948): Unified the island in 1815 after the fall of the Kandyan Kingdom, expanded
plantations, railways, and modern education.
